Repository for Comp 20: Web Programming
=======================================
Tufts University, Spring 2014
-----------------------------

### What is this repository for? ###
This repository is a collection of some of the work that I did for Tufts University's Web Programming class, which I took in the Spring of 2014.

### What was your favorite project of lab ###
I really enjoyed building the 2048 gamecenter, since I had never worked with server-side development. Also, it allowed me to see how I could extend existing projects on the web.

### What project or lab are you most proud of? ###
I am most proud of my 2048 gamecenter project.

### How much have you grown due to this class? ###
While I had worked with some client-side development before this class, my abilities in and understanding of web programming have both greatly improved. I now feel confident enough to tackle many projects, and I feel that I know how to find any resources necessary to complete any project beyond my current skill set.
